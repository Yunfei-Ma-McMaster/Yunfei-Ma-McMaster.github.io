My name is Yunfei Ma. I am a Ph.D. student in [computational science and engineering (CSE)](https://cse.mcmaster.ca/people/graduate-students.html) at [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca/). I am also a research consultant at [Geotab Inc.](https://www.geotab.com/) working on freight transportation insights. My research focuses on vehicle telematics data modeling and visualization. My mission is to tackle traffic congestion through big data and high-performance computing. I believe the next decade is the decade of smart transportation.
