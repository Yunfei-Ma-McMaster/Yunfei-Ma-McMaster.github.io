*In this article, I am going to follow up with the discussion of risk on an investment strategy level to answer the questions raised from my last article: is it a good decision to all-in Tesla at an investment strategy level? Or do I have to distribute my investment into a diverse portfolio?*

The hottest stock in the last few years is undoubtedly Tesla Inc. With a visionary leader Elon Musk, a great product lineup, long-term supply chain planning, and vertical integration in production, Tesla rewarded their shareholders and drove Elon Musk to be the richest person and the biggest taxpayer in the US ever. If you dig deeper into the Tesla community, particularly the Tesla investors' community, you will find a group of "all-in Tesla" enthusiasts who are putting all their investment money into only one stock Tesla. This violates many people's fundamental view on investing, which is best explained by this famous quote:

> "DONâ€™T PUT ALL YOUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET"


Most people deem the term diversification in asset allocation as their foundation for investing. I also abode by this rule when I started my stock market journey. When I looked back later as I transformed into an "all-in Tesla" investor, the rule of diversification in portfolios become more and more skeptical. We believe in the rule and the seemingly correct math behind it to manage risk for our portfolios.  We have followed and hardly doubted it. However, as more and more financially rewarded and intelligent people in the "all-in Tesla" community come to the spotlight and showcase their returns, I am curious to rethink and understand the essence of portfolio diversification and risk management in investing. Why does concentration instead of diversification bring success in the case of Tesla?


"If you luckily all-in on the best-performing stock in the stock market, you will crush almost all other investors because you are taking much more risks." This is the typical narrative for those people who all in on Tesla in the last 2 years. Based on the concept of portfolio diversification, the calculated risk of buying one stock is higher than owning one stock. If you go through any articles online regarding investment portfolios, they will be telling you to diversify with some concrete mathematical proof to support their arguments. It does make some sense and most people feel uncertainty about owning just one thing. Also, people have the psychology of participating in things that other credible people say are good investments.  However, after 2 years of interacting with some of the smartest people in the Tesla community, my feeling tells me there is something wrong--there is something that the portfolio diversification theory is missing. It is the dirty trick played by Wall Street.

Let's take a step back and look at a hypothetical situation. Suppose you are a primary school student. There is a special exam with an unlimited number of all True/False questions. You have limited time to finish the exam. The final score is the weighted average of the questions you did. If you do only one question and you are right, you get a 100% score. If you do ten questions and 4 are correct, you get 40%. The question is: what is your strategy for taking this exam? There are 3 basic scenarios for 3 groups of people. If you understand the materials in the exam very well, your likely optimal strategy is to choose the one question you are most sure about. Then do the question and submit it. You do not care if you can or cannot do other questions. If you know a little bit of each question but are not sure about any of the questions, your choice is to do those questions that you seem to understand but are not 100% sure about. You cannot do one question like the previous scenario because if you did it wrong, you get a 0. If you do not study the material at all, your choice is obviously to do as many questions as possible randomly. By the law of large numbers, you will likely get a near 50% grade. Another choice is also to risk on any one question, you have the possibility to spend no time studying and get a 100% score.

The example of doing such an exam reveals the one thing that is missing in any portfolio management theory, which is the person's understanding of the investment target. The reader can pause here and think about other possible scenarios for the exam example that could happen. For example, those people who pretend to understand the material but are lazy to think about the questions tend to cheat on the exam, which is similar to people trying to copy other people's investments. The example tells us that no financial model can accurately capture a person's knowledge and insights on an asset, which is, however, the most important element of making an investment decision. In the stock market as a retail investor, portfolio diversification will force you to play the fool's game even if you feel you are smart, and gradually forget what is the most important thing in investing--knowledge. Those Tesla investors are the smart people who do extensive research on the stock, and they only care if their choice of Tesla is correct, like the really smart people in the exam example. Most retail investors who are doing portfolio management and adjusting their portfolio frequently are the most likely to be crushed by the market because they use risk management to adjust their ignorance of companies' real fundamentals, like the second group in the exam example. That is why people buying index funds will outperform those portfolio management people long-term with close to index returns, like the third group of people in the exam example with an expected score of 50%.

Why do Wall Street and all the investment courses brainwash retail investors on the concept of diversification? It is not hard to understand from an economic incentive perspective. What all these investment firms do is fundamentally asset management. From this point of view, they have no interest in informing their investors that "Tesla is the best stock and all-in on it". All these firms have a business model of making money from management fees. Therefore, no diversification, no management fees, and no profits for these financial institutions. Diversification is better to be called the "foundation for management fee" than a fundamental rule for investing. Diversification targets the market of a huge group of retail investors who do not have a thorough analysis and high-level understanding of businesses and profit from the ignorance and lazy mindset of these people.  For average retail investors, diversification is the stupid tax that big investment firms lure you to pay. It tricked you to play the game with the rules of the big financial institutions' setup. One should always remember the only thing that leads to success in investing is knowledge--how much you understand the asset, period. 

So, how should we understand diversification in investing? It depends on what kind of investor you are. For retail investors with a good amount of cash and who are living a high-than-mid-class life, investing is all about information and knowledge. These people have reasonable distribution in real estate, a stake in their small business or a big company, and some other assets. Rather than over-diversification into 10 different stocks, these people can take advantage of their liquidity and education to thoroughly understand one good investment and take a large bet on it. If the person does not have time and interest in picking one stock, instead of distributing randomly to 10 different stocks heard from TikTok, buying an index fund is a much better choice as explained in the special exam example. It is not a good choice for young people and people in poverty to spend any time on the stock market. It is a sad truth that a stock market is a good place for opportunity only if you have a reasonable amount of capital. Otherwise, the time and energy spent on taking bets in stocks do not worth it. The better use of time is to get educated and employed. For the super-rich and large financial institutions participating in the first and secondary market, diversification makes sense with certain conditions. First, the people or the institutions should have the human capital to analyze and background-check a large pool of investment targets. The level of detail and depth of research a group or an institution can achieve is almost impossible for retail investors. Second, the capital/liquidity of an institution exceeds the market capitalization of the investment target. For example, in the angel investing market, the fund may have several hundred million dollars while the startups may only have a market cap of several million dollars. There is a limit that one fund that can participate in the fundraising of a startup company. Therefore, in this case, it makes sense for the fund to distribute the money to over one hundred startups. Therefore, diversification can be viewed as a forces strategy for large capitals in which they do not have the privilege to take large bets on the company that their fund size is much larger than the market capitalization.

The dirty truth that Wall Street does not tell you about portfolio diversification is that they ignore the most significant element of a person's understanding of an investment target, which is the most significant element in investment decisions but hard to quantify in any portfolio management model. The big institutions trick most retail investors to play by the rules that they are forced to play and crush regular investors with their information and power for manipulation. For regular retail investors, diversification is not a fundamental rule for investing but a "foundation for investment fees" that Wall Street firms use to diminish independent thinking and gather money from the public. Diversification is not the golden rule for risk management, and over-diversification is harmful to learning a long-term and knowledge-based mindset in investing. With the different amounts of capital, different diversification strategies should be evaluated with different standards and employed differently. The only luxury edge retailers have over large institutions their related capital sizes allow them to take big bets on one company and move positions very fast. Therefore, for retail investors, the best strategy to outperform the market is to take a large bet in one stock that they have a high-level understanding of the business and its risk, then follow the company on an almost daily basis and leverage information and knowledge of the company to make a better decision on buying and exiting to manage risks.
